# C3A
A tensorflow 2.0 implementation of C3A. We offered a testbed for XAI methods on few-shot backbone.
XAI methods include: LIME, SHAP, GradCAM, ProtoShotXAI, SINEX/SINEXC. We used ProtoNet as the few-shot model when the backbone was trained.

## Platform
We write, run and test our scripts on Pycharm IDE, which we recommand you to reproduce on. However, due to the self-implemented 
function of Pycharm IDE, some path error might orrur when running on other platform, yet you may still adjust the system path to solve it.

We also recommand running the code on Linux (ours is Ubuntu-20.04).
